# Instagram-Post-Downloader

A **simple Instagram post downloader** built with **Puppeteer**. This script allows users to download all images from any public post (or private post if logged in) and saves them in a structured folder based on the username.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Downloads all images from an Instagram post**  
✅ **Handles multiple images in a post (carousel support)**  
✅ **Skips low-quality images (under 50KB)**  
✅ **Keeps asking for new links until you exit**  
✅ **Stores images in a folder named after the Instagram user**  

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
- Install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (Make sure `npm` is included)  

### **2️⃣ Download & Install Dependencies**  
- **Clone the repository** or **download the ZIP**  
- Extract the files  
- **Run `run_instasaver.bat`** (This will install dependencies and start the script)  

### **3️⃣ Using the Script**  
- After running `run_instasaver.bat`, the script will ask:  
  `Would you like to log in to Instagram? (Y/N):`  
  - **Press `Y`** if you want to download from private accounts (⚠️ **Login is currently not working properly!** See Known Issues).  
  - **Press `N`** to proceed without logging in.  
- Then, paste an **Instagram post URL**.  
- The script will download and save the images.  
- It will then ask for another post URL.  
- **Type `exit` to stop the script.**


## ⚠️ Known Issues  
- **Login functionality is currently unreliable.** Logged-in users may experience **issues with image detection**. If you log in, you might get `Found 0 image(s) in the post.`  
  - **Temporary fix:** Run the script **without logging in** and try downloading public posts.  
- **Private account posts require login**, but this feature may not work correctly at the moment.
